# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
Daunting but rewarding. There were definitely moments of frustration and confusion. Recalling all the more basic stuff that was learned earlier in the week was difficult at times because I was thinking too complex. There was a lot of googling and revisiting of notes involved.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Pretty well. As the week went on and the subject matter became more difficult, I definitely found myself taking more frequent, but smaller breaks. Stepping away for five minutes and going outside really helped.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? 
This lesson *really* did encompass everything we've learned. It just goes to show that the house is only as strong as the foundation. I plan on going back through some of the lesson plans during the break leading up to mod1 to keep my mind sharp and make some of these lessons seem like "second nature," if you will.
